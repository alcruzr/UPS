# Intro
This is the San Jose State University EE198 Senior Design project created by Angel Cruz, Jose Guerra Fajardo, and Miguel Angel Isasi Cedillo. 

# Objective
The objective of this project was to create an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) System. The UPS system serves two purposes, to provide backup power during main grid power outages, and to help save elactrical Consumption costs through a power saving mode called "peak hours" mode. 

The UPS system has been designed to be implemented in a hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) room. The UPS system will be able to accept up to two 120V AC inputs and will have an internal 12V 150Ah lithium battery which will be capable of supplying up to 200W for 4 hours under full load. The battery will be able to be fully charged in 7.5 hours via an internal 20A battery charger. 

The peak hours mode will serve as a way to help reduce consumer electricity costs by allowing the UPS load to be powerd by the internal battery during the hours of the day that electricity costs are the highest.
